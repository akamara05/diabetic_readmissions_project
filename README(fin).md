## Executive Sumary 


I obtaind 100,000+ from a 

1. Begin with an executive summary:
   - What is your goal?
   - What are your metrics?
   - What were your findings?
   - What risks/limitations/assumptions affect these findings?
   

Hyperglycemia( High Blood Sugar) , a build up of glucose in a person's bloodstream at dangerously high levels due to a perspn's body not being able to produce enough insulin.

## Problem Statement 

## Introduction

2. Walk through your model step by step, starting with EDA
   - What are your variables of interest?
   - What outliers did you remove?
   - What types of data imputation did you perform?


## Modeling 
Three classification models were used: Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest. A basleine score of () was established. Then I leveraged GridSearchCV to identify the best scores and parameters possible for our models. The results are consoldiate in teh table below. 
 
 |Model||R2 Training Score||R2 Testing Score||Accuracy|
 |-----||-----------------||----------------||--------|
 |Logistic Regression||
 |KNN||
 |Random Forest||
 |Logistic w/ Important Features||
 |KNN w/ Important Features||
 |Random Forest w/ Important Features||
 
3. Summarize your statistical analysis, including:
   - model selection
   - implementation
   - evaluation
   - inference
