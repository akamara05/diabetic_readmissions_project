## Data Science Immersive | Capstone, Part 2		
Your project criteria were derived from the following standards, taken from our data science workflow:

- [ ] Identify Problem
- [ ] Parse Data
- [ ] Refine Data

Acceptable performance for these standards is based on how well you've performed the specific requirements listed below.

## Performance Evaluation
> Instructors: Mark sections with an `X` or `n/a` if a score does not apply. Grades and indiviual feedback are only necessary for **"Required"** sections; bonus objectives are primarily intended for student enrichment.

#### RUBRIC
Score  | Expectations
--- | ---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_


#### REQUIRED
1. Find and Clean Your Data: Source and format the required data for your project. 
   - Create a database
   - Create a data dictionary
2. Perform preliminary data munging and cleaning of your data: organize your data relevant to your project goals. 
   - Review data to verify initial assumptions
   - Clean and munge data as necessary
3. Describe your data: keep your intended audience(s) in mind.
   - Document your work so far in a Jupyter notebook. 

#### BONUS
4. Document your project goals (revise from your initial pitch)
   - Articulate “Specific aim”
   - Outline proposed methods and models
   - Define risks & assumptions

5. Create a blog post of at least 500 words that describes your work so far. Link to it in your Jupyter notebook.

## Score:
Based on the requirements, it is possible to earn a maximum of  **X**  points on this project. Your score is: **X**

- Remember, total scores are helpful as an indicator of how well you followed project instructions, but the most important feedback is to follow up on any actionable advice from your instructors for improving your project in the future!

> Note: The following section is an optional format for providing feedback on a student's overall progress in the course. Use of this format may vary by market; check with your local instructional team for more details.

## PROGRESS REPORT
**Student Check-in:**

|WHAT’S GOING WELL/STRUGGLES|DEVELOPMENT PLAN|INSTRUCTOR FEEDBACK|
|---------------------------|----------------|-------------------|
|I have tutorials readily available to help scrap the YT data that I need. What I'm struggling with is that I can only seem to obtain data for one video for one channel, my code isn't giving me the same details for all the videos I want per YT page. Also I'll need to take a step back and include code that gets me my initial list of yt channels, specifically vlog channels. What's encouraging is that YT has a good amount of detail per video so my EDA should be vast enough.  I'm encouraged that this project is doable.                       | I'm giving myself till end of day Tuesday(9/14) to get all my data and begin EDA, I'm aware this is later than the expected timeline so I have some catching up to do.                |                   |
